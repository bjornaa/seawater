The seawater package
====================

Introduction
------------

The seawater module provides basic functions in Python for physical
properties of sea water. The scope is similar to the MATLAB toolboxes
SEAWATER from CSIRO and parts of OCEANS from Woods Hole Institute.

Most of the formulas used are taken from Unesco's joint panel on oceanographic
tables and standards, UNESCO 1981 and UNESCO 1983.

The present version is 1.1, released 07 November 2004

User documentation
------------------

The functions are mainly polynomials, with an occasional fractional
exponent. The functions can therefore be used traditionally without NumPy to
compute a single value. With NumPy the functions act like "ufuncs" in the
NumPy sence. This means that they can take array arguments and return an
array of the same shape.


Public functions:

   dens(S,T,P)           Density of sea water              kg/m**3

   adtgrad(S,T,P)        Adiabatic lapse rate              K/dbar
   temppot(S,T,P,Pref)   Potential temperature             °C
   temppot0(S,T,P)       Potential temperature             °C
   
 Miscellaneous
   freezept(S,P)         Freezing point                    °C
   soundvel(S,T,P)       Sound velocity                    m/s
   depth(P,lat)          Depth                             m

 Arguments:
   S                     Salinity                 
   T                     Temperature                       °C
   P                     Pressure                          dbar 
   R                     Conductivity ratio
   Pref                  Reference pressure                dbar
   lat                   Latitude                          deg


Test scripts
------------

The test directory contains several test scripts. The script test.py tests some
standard values in the UNESCO 1983 report.  The script testwater.py prints out
part of table A3.1 in the book by Gill (1982). To recreate the potential
temperature values the alternative function temppot0, implementing an
algorithm from Bryden (1973), is used.

The scripts testdens, testsalt, testheat, and testmisc computes and prints 
tables from the UNESCO 1983 report.

Install
-------

The seawater package is written in pure Python and should work on any system. 
NumPy is not necessary, but highly recommended. To install the package, use
the commands:

    python setup.py build
    python setup.py install

(the install commmand may need root access).
